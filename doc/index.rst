dirty_cat: machine learning on dirty categories

.. currentmodule:: dirty_cat

`dirty_cat` helps with machine-learning on
non-curated categories. It provides **encoders that are
robust to morphological variants**, such as typos, in the category strings.

The :class:`SuperVectorizer` is a high-level transformer that can
automatically turn a heterogeneous data table, as a pandas dataframe, to
a numerical array, suitable for machin learning.


**Dirty category encoder**: `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_'s
:class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` can be replaced by:

* :class:`GapEncoder`, scalable and interpretable, where each encoding
  dimension corresponds to a topic that summarizes substrings captured.

* :class:`SimilarityEncoder`, a simple modification of one-hot encoding
  to capture the strings.

* :class:`MinHashEncoder`, very scalable


For a detailed description of the problem of encoding dirty categorical data,
see `Similarity encoding for learning with dirty categorical variables
<https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01806175>`_ [1]_ and `Encoding high-cardinality
string categorical variables <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02171256v4>`_ [2]_.

About
=========

dirty_cat is for now a repository for developing ideas with high-quality
implementations, a form of a research project: there is still
little known about the problems of dirty categories. We hope that
tradeoffs will emerge in the long run, and that these tradeoffs will
enable us to do better software. We really need people giving feedback on
success and failures with the different techniques and pointing us to
open datasets on which we can do more empirical work. We also welcome
contributions in the scope of dirty categories.
